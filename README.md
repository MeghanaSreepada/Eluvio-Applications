# # Eluvio Internship Assessment

This is my submission for Eluvio Internship Assessment. I have chosen the Option 2 - Applications challenge.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- aiohttp
- asyncio (comes with python)
- base64 (comes with python)
- random (comes with python)
- time (comes with python)

### Instructions to execute
First install the prerequisites using pip package manager.

```
pip install aiohttp
```

Now we can execute the program by running the command below
```

```

### Parameters you can play with for random ids generation
All the parameters are present in the main function.
- batch_size - Used to generate batches of ids.
- max_id - Max possible id which can be generated. 

In case you would like to change the input IDs to something more realistic, you can pass them as a list to the preprocess_batch() function.
